# osurandomdl

This is intended as a side project where you can randomly download any beatmaps for the rhythym game [osu!](https://osu.ppy.sh/home) based on a set of parameters. I will probably not maintain this much after I am done with it, but if a signicifant issue does arise, just submit an issue or something.
