# osurandomdl

This is python desktop application utilizing PyQt5 for the GUI. This is intended to allow users to randomly download any beatmaps for the rhythym game [osu!](https://osu.ppy.sh/home) based on a set of parameters. I will most likely be using v1 of the osu! API as v2 requires dealing with OAuth2.0 and I don't feel like dealing with that hassle until I have to. When v1 finally gets completely fazed out I'll switch to v2. As this is under heavy development I will not have installers for a while, so if you want to try out what little I have you'll need to install python 3 and PyQt5 yourself, though I doubt anybody will find this unless I tell them lol.
